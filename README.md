# Zombie-Apocalypse
The project involves a simple zombie game using Python. 

This is a Python program that simulates a text-based adventure game. It begins with a visual representation of a figure, followed by a welcome message and a mission statement. The player is prompted to make a choice by inputting "left" or "right". Their input is converted to lowercase to standardize the input process.

If the player chooses "left", they will be presented with another choice: to "wait" or to "swim". Depending on their choice, they will be presented with yet another choice of selecting a door with a specific color. The result of their final choice will determine the outcome of the game.

If the player chooses "right" initially, they will reach a point where they will confront a zombie ambush, and the game will end.

The provided code uses various nested if-else statements to create this decision tree and simulate the game
